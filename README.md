# MySQL-Storefront

This is an app that is basically a storefront. The theme is Pokemon, and the user is prompted to purchase items from the shop. The user gets to select items from a dropdown list, and if the item is not available then the request is rejected. When finished with that request, the user is prompted if they want to do another purchase, and if yes it goes back to purchase menu. If not, the connection closes.
